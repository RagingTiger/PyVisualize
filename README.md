## Introduction
**PyVisualize** was developed to solve a specific problem: how do I visualize
large quantities of simulation data generated by [**NetLogo BehaviorSpace**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html)?
With **PyVisualize** the NetLogo user is able to take their BehaviorSpace data,
which is in **CSV** format, convert it to [**HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), and choose the **data source**
and **time point** for coloring and generating a **2D heatmap**. Now the user
has a heatmap representing all the simulations from their data, and each colored
tile in the heatmap can be clicked to generate another window which plots all
data for that simulation.

The user can now easily sift through large quantities of simulation data by
choosing different time points and data sets to color the heatmap, and then
visually inspecting which "tiles" are more interesting.

</p>

### Clone Repository
The repository can also be cloned to your local desktop. Simply navigate to
the [green button](https://github.com/RagingTiger/PyVisualize) titled **Clone or download**, click the button, and then click
the small **"clipboard"** icon to copy the url. Then, on your local machine
open a terminal application and navigate to the directory you would like to
clone the repository and execute the following:

```
git clone url
```

where **"url"** is what was copied earlier when you clicked the clipboard icon.
