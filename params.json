  "body": "## Introduction\r\n**PyVisualize** was developed to solve a specific problem: how do I visualize\r\nlarge quantities of simulation data generated by [**NetLogo BehaviorSpace**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html)?\r\nWith **PyVisualize** the NetLogo user is able to take their BehaviorSpace data,\r\nwhich is in **CSV** format, convert it to [**HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), and choose the **data source**\r\nand **time point** for coloring and generating a **2D heatmap**. Now the user\r\nhas a heatmap representing all the simulations from their data, and each colored\r\ntile in the heatmap can be clicked to generate another window which plots all\r\ndata for that simulation.\r\n\r\nThe user can now easily sift through large quantities of simulation data by\r\nchoosing different time points and data sets to color the heatmap, and then\r\nvisually inspecting which \"tiles\" are more interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/RagingTiger/gifs/raw/d7d63d1f79c726307a08a1c40ff7901ee9942f98/PyVisualizeDownloadInstallerTutorial.gif\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Download Installer\r\nCurrently, only MacOSX versions of the software exist and can be downloaded\r\nfrom the [releases](https://github.com/RagingTiger/PyVisualize/releases)\r\nsection (as shown above).\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/RagingTiger/gifs/raw/d7d63d1f79c726307a08a1c40ff7901ee9942f98/PyVisualizeGitCloneTutorial.gif\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Clone Repository\r\nThe repository can also be cloned to your local desktop. Simply navigate to\r\nthe [green button](https://github.com/RagingTiger/PyVisualize) titled **Clone or download**, click the button, and then click\r\nthe small **\"clipboard\"** icon to copy the url. Then, on your local machine\r\nopen a terminal application and navigate to the directory you would like to\r\nclone the repository and execute the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone url\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere **\"url\"** is what was copied earlier when you clicked the clipboard icon.\r\n\r\n## Tutorial\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wsCRWob480Y\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/wsCRWob480Y/0.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\"/></a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  Click the tutorial above to learn about PyVisualize's features.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/RagingTiger/PyVisualize/blob/cd432c4d9fc8ac722cd7fa64657bf662592e5cc1/LICENSE) file for details\r\n",
